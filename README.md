ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sivert. I'm a Norwegian mix engineer (I make artists' music sound better), and I've pretty much just gotten into webdesign/dev as a hobby.
I don't have too much experience under my belt as of yet! Previously I've made a simple page for my business, with a custom contact form and a wordpress blog on it.
Right now I'm working on a new page, using Craft as a headless CMS so that I can publish articles and portfolio-stuff! 

My HTML is pretty good now, but theres still a lot to learn in the front-end world (and ESPECIALLY in back-end). I really like using Bootstrap 5 for CSS right now.

Stuff I want/need to learn:
* Vanilla javascript
* Master Bootstrap (or perhaps switch to Tailwind?)
* Vue or React
* Really want to learn to use Sanity as a headless CMS, as it is a norwegian company. Way too techincal for me right now, though.
